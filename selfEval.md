# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? I productively struggled a little bit on the last problem in objects until I realized the seperate email logs were objects in the array itself.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Note taking has been the biggest help in understanding what's going on. I started really taking good notes around arrays but it has made it easier to go and review and know exactly where things are.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? Googling has been a good help but I find a lot of the answers on there don't actually help and finding the proper source is key. I personally lean into trying to solve the problem myself, then googling, and then trying to reach out in that order.
